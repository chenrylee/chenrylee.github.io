# Use My Old Password in Big Sur
Apple released the new MacOS, Big Sur, AKA Bug Surprise.  
After upgrading to the new OS, I was pissed off by the new features:
- Touch ID didn't work.
- Old password didn't work.

Lock the screen and re-sign in, I was prompted to change password! My password is a 6-digit simple password, and it required my new password with compex combinations.

Thank God! There's a solution.  
1. Start Terminal;
2. Type follow command:  
   ```bash
   pwpolicy -clearaccountpolicies
   ```
3. You will be asked to enter your password for your admin Profile.  
   âš  Terminal WILL NOT show the password as you type it.
4. You're all done! Now go to System Preferences -> Users & Groups to reset your password.
